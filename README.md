# Introduction

STARMAN helps you to rock your computer, no matter what OS it has. The star in the name means anything, but currently, it focuses on package installation and management to liberate us from boring tasks. Do you remember how many times some packages drive you crazy? STARMAN will rule them for you!

This is the rewrite of my previous work [PACKMAN](https://github.com/dongli/packman). There are some flaws in PACKMAN, so I want to eliminate them in STARMAN, and bring some new features:

- Remote installation
- Precompiled binary
- Be nice with system packages

I try to use the best practices in Ruby, so if you are a Rubyist, join me.
